# PACK P — Behavior-preserving TUI Decomposition

Canonical tracker: #183. Parent architecture roadmap: #180.

## Baseline

- PACK P start `main`: `a512578681f5c391c1aeb1f48881b4460dc40f62`
- PACK O is complete; #9/#178 closed and PR #179 merged.
- Rust MSRV: 1.88.
- Product behavior, provider semantics, keybindings, Action/Effect/Job contracts, and runtime authority are frozen unless a separately reviewed issue explicitly changes them.

## Goal

Decompose `src/tui.rs` incrementally so rendering, feature orchestration, input routing, and async response handling have explicit testable module boundaries. This pack is a refactor, not a feature pack.

## Sequence

- [x] P0 — characterization baseline for the seams that move first
- [ ] P1 — pure presentation-model extraction into `src/tui/` submodules
- [ ] P2 — frame/render-only extraction
- [ ] P3 — feature-controller extraction in independently green slices
- [ ] P4 — keyboard/mouse routing extraction
- [ ] P5 — Effect/Job response handling extraction
- [ ] P6 — thin runtime/event-loop composition root
- [ ] P7 — docs/final exact-head acceptance and PACK P closure

## Completed: P0 + P1a

The first code transaction was deliberately narrow and is complete.

PR #186 accepted exact head `43f70e8eb535c0eab7a658b7368a3970a131540a` with CI #644 / run `32589046943` fully green: quality, Rust 1.88 MSRV, Apache mod_dav W1–W18 physical acceptance, and MinIO safe-read retry physical acceptance.

Squash merge on `main`: `32f649816adb3e04b0d9f415ac352601a9b699a4`.

P0 added semantic characterization for the workspace ribbon while existing session-callout, footer/command-bar, Quick Action / Remote Edit safety, and S3 identity/selection regressions remained green.

P1a created `src/tui/presentation.rs` and moved only the workspace ribbon and session-callout presentation model. Frame rendering, routing, Action dispatch, Effect/Job handling, provider execution, and feature-controller ownership remained in `src/tui.rs`.

P1 remains open because additional presentation-only seams may still move as later rendering slices expose them.

## Active transaction: P2a leaf overlays

Tracked by #187.

Extract only leaf frame/render helpers into `src/tui/overlays.rs`:

- `render_session_callout`
- `render_help`
- `help_full_lines`
- `render_viewer`
- `render_bookmarks`

This transaction may preserve the existing `help_scroll` clamp mutation because it is UI-only state. It must not move or change `render()` itself, pane rendering/state, command-bar hitboxes, Which-Key, sync-preview rendering, Hosts/SSH orchestration, event routing, Action dispatch, Effect/Job handling, or provider behavior.

Use focused semantic/render characterization rather than whole-screen golden snapshots.

## Acceptance

Every extraction must pass locally and on exact PR head:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo check --locked --all-features
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked --all-features
cargo +1.88 check --locked --all-features
git diff --check
```

CI must retain quality, Rust 1.88 MSRV, Apache mod_dav W1–W18 physical acceptance, and MinIO transfer-queue retry physical acceptance. Substantial extraction PRs also require Release validation before merge.

## Scope guards

PACK P must not introduce:

- new product actions/features;
- new shortcuts;
- provider/VFS behavior changes;
- duplicate JobManager / scheduler / Effect ownership;
- Lua/WASM/native plugin runtime;
- PACK Q ProviderRegistry convergence changes;
- PACK R registration abstractions.

If an extraction requires a semantic change to compile, stop and split/review that semantic change separately instead of hiding it inside the refactor.
